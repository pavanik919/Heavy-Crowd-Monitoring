Live data dashboards would alert authorities when density thresholds are breached—particularly near choke points like Gate No. 7.

Automated alerts via mobile apps or security channels could mobilize emergency services or guide the crowd to safer zones in real-time.

Drones and AI-powered cameras would offer aerial and ground visuals to help redirect flows and proactively manage surges.

Controlled communication systems—like official apps or digital signage—can curb misinformation, ensuring clear, uniform messaging.
